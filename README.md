# Flatiron Showcase

## Where Flatiron Students prove their mettle

The Flatiron Showcase was built as a platform for Flatiron School students to showcase their projects and build a personal profile around those projects.

The project is currently online at [flatiron-showcase.herokuapp.com](http://flatiron-showcase.herokuapp.com)

## Background

Flatiron School students are intelligent, hardworking, and passionate. After working with an amazing group for three months, Boyoung and Ariel wanted to create a platform where everyone could get a taste of the intensity and creativity of Flatiron students.

The results astounded us, and we hope you too will be wowed by the accomplishments of Flatiron students.

## User Stories

Flatiron students can upload their projects and are presented with a rich interface to highlight key points about their projects.

Employers and potential students can view a student's portfolio and see more information about a particular project.

## Development/Contribution

Got some good ideas?  Fork, make a feature branch, and pull request.  We would love to expand the functionality of the app.

## Future

We would like to implement search functionality to make it easy to browse by a student's name.  We may also implement more filters, e.g. Ruby/iOS class.
